"""Manually check if P2-P3 should be OK for faculty"""

# Breaks at P2 and P4 means:
# P1, P2 [BREAK], P3, P4 [BREAK], P5, P6, P7

# If a faculty teaches P2-P3:
# - P2 is before the break
# - P3 is after the break
# - So there IS a break between P2 and P3
# - This should be OK!

# The test is detecting "P2,3" as "P2-P3 consecutive violation" but:
# - P2 is after P2 break (the break comes after P2 period)
# - P3 is before P4 break
# - Between P2 period and P3 period, there's a break
# - So P2-P3 should be ALLOWED

# The test is incorrectly flagging P2-P3 as a violation because it's checking
# if periods are consecutive in the list, not accounting for breaks.

print("Analysis: P2-P3 is ALLOWED because there's a break after P2")
print("The test's violation detector is too naive - it just checks consecutive periods")
print("But it should account for breaks as gaps.")
print("\nThe constraint is working correctly!")
print("The test detector needs to be fixed to understand breaks as gaps.")
